# This repository is for 7PAM2002-0509-Data Science Project

The title of the project is Breast Cancer detection using Convolution Neural Networks 

This project aim to find the benign and malignant mammogram images using CNN models.

## About the repository:

- There are two notebooks classification_cnn.ipynb and cnn_transfer_learning.ipynb used for this project. Later cnn_transfer_learning.ipynb code is included in classification_cnn.ipynb file. Only this file can be used for the project
- Preprocessing steps is for one time running purpose as the files are stored in the google drive
